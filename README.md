# Functions in JavaScript

For this practice we were asked to complete a series of exercises to sharpen our skills with javascript functions. 

## Practice 1 Assignment: Chicken Monkey
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of five (5, 10, 15, etc.) print "Chicken" instead of the number and for the multiples of seven (7, 14, 21, etc.) print "Monkey". For numbers which are multiples of both five and seven print "ChickenMonkey".

To determine if a number can be evenly divided by 5 or 7, use the JavaScript remainder operator.

## Practice 2 Assignment: Battle of the Bands
A local nightclub is having a Battle of the Bands night in a few months. They expect many bands to sign up because the grand prize is $20,000. To make things easier on the nightclub management, they want each band to be assigned a number so that they can easily keep track of the order in which the bands will perform.

Your job is to write a function that accepts any band name as an argument. The function will increment a global variable by one each time it is invoked, and return that number, and the band name concatenated together.

## Practice 3 Assignment: Cookout
Your task is to iterate over the array of uncookedFood and invoke the function for each item so that the cookedFood array contains all of the items after they are cooked.

## Practice 4 Assignment: Overly Excited
For this exercise, you need to create a single JavaScript function named addExcitement that will use console.log() to print out a sentence to the browser console.

Create an addExcitement function that should console.log() rows of words. It should take an array containing the words of a sentence and output them in the developer console.

Add logic to addExcitement that places an exclamation point (!) after every third word. Read the following English statement and write the equivalent in JavaSript code to make it work.

Add a new argument to the function so that a developer can specify which character should be displayed instead of it always being an exclamation point.

## Challenge: Arrow Functions
Refactor practice 4 assignment to take the form of an arrow function.
